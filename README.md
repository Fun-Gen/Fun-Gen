## Academic Integrity

While the Allen School institutes an academic misconduct policy where

> If you have CSE homeworks, including from previous quarters, publicly available (e.g., in a GitHub repository), this is a violation of our academic misconduct policy and you should make them private immediately

..., this is a public repository on GitHub per the [assignment spec](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~rjust/courses/CSE403/project/03_github.html) and the [project description](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~rjust/courses/CSE403/project/project.html):

> Create a ***public*** repository for your project on GitHub, make all team members contributors, and add a link to this repository to your living document.

> We require that you use a ***public*** GitHub repository for version control, issue tracking, and continuous integration.
