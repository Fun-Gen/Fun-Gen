# Fun Gen

UW CSE 403 Spring 2022 Group Project

### What is Fun Gen?

Fun Gen is an iOS app with a user created list of activities in a friend, coworker, or family group. Users propose an activity in a user defined category (vacation, road trip, movie night, etc.) and the options can be voted on or just randomly selected if the group does not want to vote. Example activities include a family trip with family members submitting and/or voting on a destination, a couple having trouble deciding on what to watch on Netflix, or coworkers picking a restaurant for a company outing.

### Goals

- List of options to vote on for the activity

## Academic Integrity

While the Allen School institutes an academic misconduct policy where

> If you have CSE homeworks, including from previous quarters, publicly available (e.g., in a GitHub repository), this is a violation of our academic misconduct policy and you should make them private immediately

..., this is a public repository on GitHub per the [assignment spec](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~rjust/courses/CSE403/project/03_github.html) and the [project description](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~rjust/courses/CSE403/project/project.html):

> Create a ***public*** repository for your project on GitHub, make all team members contributors, and add a link to this repository to your living document.

> We require that you use a ***public*** GitHub repository for version control, issue tracking, and continuous integration.
