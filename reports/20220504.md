    - What you did:
        - Implemented the landing page, merged into main branch, and did revisions on the 
          Architecture and Design assignment
    - What worked:
        - Pair programming and communicating with the other frontend team to merge into main branch
    - What you learned:
        - Learned a lot more on Swiftui through watching a tutorial video, like creating test data, NaviationView, etc.
    - Where you had trouble:
        - Still not very proficient in Swift/ Swiftui so often had to refer back to the tutorial/ online resources.
    - Where you are stuck:
        - Currently waiting to implement a store class that keeps track of all of the activities, but waiting on approval
          from the rest of the team to ensure no conflicts occur/ potential better ways of implementing this
