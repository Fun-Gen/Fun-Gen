# Weekly Status Report 2022-04-27

## Team Report

### Goals from Last Week

- Get landing page for frontend setup
- Backend is able to hold and sync user profiles and activity data
- Finish continuous delivery setup and add all team members to internal TestFlight

### Progress and Issues

- What we did
    - Frontend team worked on views relating to landing, voting, and activity creation.
    - We also defined data types for the project and worked on defining architecture and design.
- What worked for us
    - Meeting up in person on T/TH
    - Using the group text message
    - Working separately as frontend team and backend team, and using meetings to update each other  
- What we learned
    - What information (ex. data types) should be saved in the database
- What we had trouble with
    - Learning and developing at the same time with new features in SwiftUI and Swift
- Where we are stuck
    - Figuring out how to connect different views made by different team members, ensuring that design is cohesive, and we are setting up backend with frontend correctly.

### Goals for Next Week

- Set up the database
- Finalize the UI and interactions for the landing and voting page

#### Agenda for Project Meeting

- Review progress and UI designs for home page, create activity page, and voting page
- Distribute tasks to work on for the next week
- Review agreed tasks/plan with TA
