## Team Report

### Goals from Last Week

- Learn how to program in Swift and SwiftUI, and using Xcode: Joon, Angkana, Elena, Julian. Finnigan
- Setup the iOS project and document the setup process: Apollo
- Setup the development environment and inform Apollo of issues in setup process documentation: everyone
- Research backend implementation: Julian, Finnigan

### Progress and Issues

- What we did:
    - Environment setup, learning Swift and SwiftUI basics, and set up Firebase and user authentication.
- What worked for us:
    - Watching tutorials and reading documentation.
- What we learned:
    - How to navigate Xcode and language basics.
- What we had trouble with:
    - Majority of team do not have prior experience with iOS development or Firebase.
- Where we are stuck:
    - Making sure backend has synched data and connecting the backend with the frontend.

### Goals for Next Week

- Get landing page for frontend setup
- Backend is able to hold and sync user profiles and acitvity data

#### Agenda for Project Meeting

- Distribute tasks to work on for the next week
- Review agreed tasks/plan with TA

### Progress and Issues

- Angkana Rattanasouk
    - What you did:
        - Communicated tasks and deadlines to the team.
        - Setup Xcode and learned Swift and SwiftUI basics.
        - Designed landing and voting page mockups with team.
    - What worked:
        - Reading Apple's SwiftUI tutorials, trying out basic commands to learn how to navigate Xcode, and meeting in person to check project setup.
    - What you learned:
        - That we don't have to create our UI components from scratch and can make use of the provided library.
    - Where you had trouble:
        - Having no prior experience in iOS and trying to get up to speed with learning a new tech stack.
    - Where you are stuck:
        - Figuring out what user interactions/events to add to the frontend.

- Finnigan Johnson
    - What you did: Setup XCODE environment and familiarized with the tools and workspace
    - What worked: Using the Apple SwiftUI introductory course to gain an understanding of the main concepts of SwiftUI
    - What you learned: Swift basics and the MVVM design pattern
    - Where you had trouble: Conceptually, I understood the underlying idea behind MVVM but I need to get more comfortable
      with Swift before I could do it myself
    - Where you are stuck: I don't have any prior Swift experience so I need to ramp up more
- Joon Chong
    - What you did: Downloaded Xcode and learned some of the basics of Swift through online resources. Also, collaborated
    with others to get an overall idea of the app's design and interface
    - What worked: Using online resources to learn the basics of Swift and discussing ideas with others for how
    we wanted the app to function
    - What you learned: The basics of Swift
    - Where you had trouble: Did not have too much trouble this week but as I start implementing using Swift,
    I do see myself running into some problems as I am still fairly new to this language
    - Where you are stuck: Did not really get stuck this week as all I did was spend my time learning Swift
- Julian Burrington
    - What you did
        - Learned some Swift and Xcode basics. Created simple structs/classes in a playground to think about the app's code structure, and then got the Firebase backend started. Email/password user authentication appears to have minimum functionality now even though it will require some tweaking and has a temporary awful UI. User authentication with Firebase boilerplate, config, and dependencies awaiting merge approval.
    - What worked
        - Getting up and running with Firebase, Xcode, and Swift.  
    - What you learned
        - I now have a better understanding of iOS app development than before, and spent plenty of time with Apple and Google Firebase documentation.
    - Where you had trouble
        - A lot of the Google Firebase documentation assumes that current app developers are using it, so I had to search around to learn a lot of basic things about Xcode and Swift in order to implement Firebase features.
    - Where you are stuck
        - Right now I am thinking about how to keep users synced with backend server and create storage profiles for holding all of their created/subscribed Activities in Fun Gen.

### Goals for Next Week

- Angkana Rattanasouk
    - Create a barebone interactive landing or polling page on the frontend.
- Apollo Zhu
    - TODO: plans for next week
- Elena Wu
    - TODO: plans for next week
- Finnigan Johnson
    - Communicate with the team to figure out specific tasks I could work on designing/building
- Joon Chong
    - Communicate with the team to delegate responsibilities on certain parts of the app and start implementation
- Julian Burrington
    - Continue to cleanup user authentication, implement user data storage, and ensure Activity data is updated in realtime for the user.
