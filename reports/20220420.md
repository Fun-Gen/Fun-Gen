        - Designed landing and voting page mockups with team.
    - What worked:
        - Reading Apple's SwiftUI tutorials, trying out basic commands to learn how to navigate Xcode, and meeting in person to check project setup.
    - What you learned:
        - That we don't have to create our UI components from scratch and can make use of the provided library.
    - Where you had trouble:
        - Having no prior experience in iOS and trying to get up to speed with learning a new tech stack.
    - Where you are stuck:
        - Figuring out what user interactions/events to add to the frontend.
- Apollo Zhu
    - What you did
        - Setup Xcode project and documented setup process needed by team members
        - Setup GitHub Actions CI to check for style violations
        - Contributed to discussion about UI design
        - Reviewing pull request for user authentication
        - Started to configure CD for automatically distributing to App Store
    - What worked
        - Project setup instruction is easy to follow and team members finished onboarding
        - SwiftLint can check style issues locally and on GitHub
    - What you learned
        - SwiftFormat doesn't allow undo after formatting
        - SwiftLint rules might not be able to discover all the style issues
    - Where you had trouble
        - I tried to configure DocC documentation for onboarding doc, but it didn't seem to work so I switched to GitHub Wiki instead
    - Where you are stuck
        - My personal computer with my normal icon making software (Sketch) is sent for repair and macOS icon is required for the continuous integration to pass
- Elena Wu
    - What you did
        - Set up XCode
        - Getting started with Swift and Swift UI
        - Discussed UI designs, specifically about our home page for the app 
    - What worked
        - Getting familiar with XCode
        - Going through some basic tutorials
    - What you learned
        - SwiftUI basics
        - XCode's library of UI components  
    - Where you had trouble
        - Learning Swift and SwiftUI with no prior experience 
    - Where you are stuck
        - Trying to figure out our app layout and desired features
- Finnigan Johnson
    - What you did: Setup XCODE environment and familiarized with the tools and workspace
    - What worked: Using the Apple SwiftUI introductory course to gain an understanding of the main concepts of SwiftUI
    - What you learned: Swift basics and the MVVM design pattern
    - Where you had trouble: Conceptually, I understood the underlying idea behind MVVM but I need to get more comfortable
      with Swift before I could do it myself
    - Where you are stuck: I don't have any prior Swift experience so I need to ramp up more
- Joon Chong
    - What you did: Downloaded Xcode and learned some of the basics of Swift through online resources. Also, collaborated
    with others to get an overall idea of the app's design and interface
    - What worked: Using online resources to learn the basics of Swift and discussing ideas with others for how
    we wanted the app to function
    - What you learned: The basics of Swift
    - Where you had trouble: Did not have too much trouble this week but as I start implementing using Swift,
    I do see myself running into some problems as I am still fairly new to this language
    - Where you are stuck: Did not really get stuck this week as all I did was spend my time learning Swift
- Julian Burrington
    - What you did
        - Learned some Swift and Xcode basics. Created simple structs/classes in a playground to think about the app's code structure, and then got the Firebase backend started. Email/password user authentication appears to have minimum functionality now even though it will require some tweaking and has a temporary awful UI. User authentication with Firebase boilerplate, config, and dependencies awaiting merge approval.
    - What worked
        - Getting up and running with Firebase, Xcode, and Swift.  
    - What you learned
        - I now have a better understanding of iOS app development than before, and spent plenty of time with Apple and Google Firebase documentation.
    - Where you had trouble
        - A lot of the Google Firebase documentation assumes that current app developers are using it, so I had to search around to learn a lot of basic things about Xcode and Swift in order to implement Firebase features.
    - Where you are stuck
        - Right now I am thinking about how to keep users synced with backend server and create storage profiles for holding all of their created/subscribed Activities in Fun Gen.

### Goals for Next Week

- Angkana Rattanasouk
    - Create a barebone interactive landing or polling page on the frontend.
- Apollo Zhu
    - Finish setting up continuous delivery
    - Give everyone access to App Store Connect
    - More code review and Firebase/Swift/SwiftUI support
- Elena Wu
    - plans for next week
        - Try to create the home page
- Finnigan Johnson
    - Communicate with the team to figure out specific tasks I could work on designing/building
- Joon Chong
    - Communicate with the team to delegate responsibilities on certain parts of the app and start implementation
- Julian Burrington
    - Continue to cleanup user authentication, implement user data storage, and ensure Activity data is updated in realtime for the user.
