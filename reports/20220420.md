- Finnigan Johnson
    - What you did: Setup XCODE environment and familiarized with the tools and workspace
    - What worked: Using the Apple SwiftUI introductory course to gain an understanding of the main concepts of SwiftUI
    - What you learned: Swift basics and the MVVM design pattern
    - Where you had trouble: Conceptually, I understood the underlying idea behind MVVM but I need to get more comfortable 
      with Swift before I could do it myself
    - Where you are stuck: I don't have any prior Swift experience so I need to ramp up more
- Joon Chong
    - What you did: Downloaded Xcode and learned some of the basics of Swift through online resources. Also, collaborated 
    with others to get an overall idea of the app's design and interface
    - What worked: Using online resources to learn the basics of Swift and discussing ideas with others for how
    we wanted the app to function
    - What you learned: The basics of Swift
    - Where you had trouble: Did not have too much trouble this week but as I start implementing using Swift,
    I do see myself running into some problems as I am still fairly new to this language 
    - Where you are stuck: Did not really get stuck this week as all I did was spend my time learning Swift
- Julian Burrington
    - What you did
        - Learned some Swift and Xcode basics. Created simple structs/classes in a playground to think about the app's code structure, and then got the Firebase backend started. Email/password user authentication appears to have minimum functionality now even though it will require some tweaking and has a temporary awful UI. User authentication with Firebase boilerplate, config, and dependencies awaiting merge approval.
    - What worked
        - Getting up and running with Firebase, Xcode, and Swift.  
    - What you learned
        - I now have a better understanding of iOS app development than before, and spent plenty of time with Apple and Google Firebase documentation.      
    - Where you had trouble
        - A lot of the Google Firebase documentation assumes that current app developers are using it, so I had to search around to learn a lot of basic things about Xcode and Swift in order to implement Firebase features.
    - Where you are stuck
        - Right now I am thinking about how to keep users synced with backend server and create storage profiles for holding all of their created/subscribed Activities in Fun Gen.

    - plans for next week:
        - Communicate with the team to delegate responsibilities on certain parts of the app and start implementation
- Julian Burrington
    - plans for next week
        - Continue to cleanup user authentication, implement user data storage, and ensure Activity data is updated in realtime for the user.
